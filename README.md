# Solving-the-Ice-Breaker-Problem-with-CSPs

Ice Breaker problem: given a group of n people, find the minimum number of teams they can be 
partitioned into such that no team has 2 (or more) members who are friends.

This program models this as a constraint satisfaction problem.

Part 1: solves exactly for 6 random groups of 31 people each.
Part 2: solves approximately for 6 random groups of 105 people each.
